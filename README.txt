Please Read!!

My final, final project files are primarily found in the "final-project" directory of this repository. There you can find my final report for the class named "Final_Project_Report.pdf" and the rmd file I used to create it! Also, you can find my lightening talk presentation which is a python notebook file that has full code and output! The other files in this repository consist of the different deadlines we were given throughout the quarter.
