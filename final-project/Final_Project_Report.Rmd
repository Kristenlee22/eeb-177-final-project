## Introduction

The order Pilosa is a group of placental mammals. The two orders under are Vermilingua and Folivora- more commonly known as Anteaters and Sloths. Originally, I was focusing on just sloths; however to work with a larger data set, I moved up a taxonomic level. 

Sloths have always intrigued me, so I was interested in learning more about trends in their evolution. One biological characteristic that plays a role in shaping the ecological patterns of many species is metabolism. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a primary factor shaping body size evolution [@Toledo_2017]. Xenarthrans (the superoder to Pilosa) are known to have much lower body temperatures compared to other mammals their size. Accordingly, their metabolic rates are also much lower, between 40-60% lower than what is expected based on their mass [@Gilmore_2000]. 

One way in which I could explore this evolutionary characteristic was through the distribution of the species. Poor thermoregulation and metabolism confine a species to live in warmer temperatures. Extinct ground sloths were probably able to tolerate colder temperatures due to their greater size and muscle mass [@Gilmore_2001]. But after evolving to much smaller sizes, their distribution altered as well. The current brown-throated three-toed sloth is one of the most common medium-sized mammals in the tropical forests of Central and South America [@Gilmore_2000]. 

Ultimately, as the species diversified from larger creatures to smaller, they became confined to different temperatures and locations. Using the PaleoBiology Database, I wanted to manipulate data on Pilosa to see if their locational data would ultimately parallel and support this trend.



## Description

I utilized the Paleobiology Database which houses fossil occurances along with a variety of parameters. Since, I was focusing on primarily the location of pilosa, I used locational data(latitude & longitude), age data (in MYA), and taxonomic data (order, species). I first manipulated the data to seperate/organize taxonomic and age information. Then after analyzing my narrowed down data, I combined it with locational data to visualize with matplotlib. And then I drew conclusions from analyzing my results.



## Methods & Data Manipulation

First I ran `tr -d "\n\r" < pbdb_data_pilosa_full.csv` in the terminal to elimante empty rows in the csv file. Then I wrote this function to print a list of all the species in my dataset. I created a for loop that printed the species name only if it was listed as a "species" in a seperate column.
```{python, eval = F}

in_file = open("pbdb_data_pilosa_full.csv", 'r', encoding= "ISO-8859-1") 
read_file = in_file.readlines()[18:] #starting where the occurance data starts

list_species = [] #empty list to store species in
       
for line in read_file:
    species = line.split('","')[11] #delimiter ","
    name_of_species = line.split('","')[9]
    if "species" in species:  
        list_species.append(name_of_species)
print("\n".join(list_species)) #check to see if species list printed (works)

```


Secondly, I wrote a function regarding age. 

\begin{equation}
Mean Age = (Minimum Age + Maximum Age)/2
\end{equation}

Using this simple equation, I was able to calculate the mean age of the fossils with the following function:

```{python, eval = F}

mean_age_list = []


for line in read_file:
    minage = line.split('","')[15] #'""' gets rid of quotes
    maxage = line.split('","')[16]  
    mean_age = (float(minage)+float(maxage))/ 2 

    mean_age_list.append(float(mean_age))
print(mean_age_list) 
```

I then created a set of unique ages 

```{python, eval = F}

unique_means = set() #creating a set to get the unique mean age
for item in mean_age_list:
    unique_means.add(item)

unique_means_list = list(unique_means) #converting back to list
    
print(sorted(unique_means_list))  #sort numerically

```

Next I created a dictionary that printed out the number of occurances per time period.

```{python, eval = F}
#finding which mean age had the most species present
from collections import Counter

ageDict = dict(Counter(mean_age_list)) #counts the occurences of each item in means list
print("{" + "\n".join("{}: {}".format(k, v) for k, v in ageDict.items()) + "}")

#0.06885: 127 most occurances late pleistocene
#1.29985: 110 second most pleistocene
```


I did not print out the data from all these functions to maintain organization, but the results of these functions in general gave me a better sense of the data I was working with. 

To get an even better idea of the data that I had been manipulating (species and age), I used ggplot to build a bar graph that showed the occurances (x-axis) per species (y-axis), and the age (color). From my results, I could see what time period had the most fossil occurances.

I first created a new csv file with the species in one column and mean age in the next. Then I used ggplot to graph the file. 



```{python, eval=F}
import csv #creating a new csv file with only species and age for R

with open("mean_ages_for_r.csv", 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter = ',')
    writer.writerows(list(zip(list_species, mean_age_list)))

```


```{r}

library(ggplot2)

setwd("/home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/eeb-177-final-project/final-project/")

pilosa <- read.csv("mean_ages_for_r.csv", header = F, as.is = T)
  
names(pilosa) <- c("Species", "Age")
head(pilosa)

pilosa_occ <- ggplot(pilosa, aes(Species, color = Age))
pilosa_occ <- pilosa_occ + geom_bar()
pilosa_occ <- pilosa_occ + coord_flip() + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=3)) +theme(axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
pilosa_occ + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,40), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40)) + labs(title = "Species Counts and Mean-Ages", x= "Species", y= "Occurences") 


```


## Visualization

Finally, I was able to visualize my data. First, I created lists for the latitudes and longitudes of each species:

```{python, eval=F}

latitude = [] #empty list for lat
longitude = [] #empty list for long

for line in read_file:
    lats = line.split('","')[30]
    lons = line.split('","')[29]
    latitude.append(float(lats)) #convert to float
    longitude.append(float(lons)) 
print(latitude + longitude) # checking to see it works

```

In lab we worked with matplotlib for a bit, so with the help of google and this tutorial http://introtopython.org/visualization_earthquakes.html, I was able to use a package called Basemap. Basemap is a library for plotting 2D data on maps.

The first code and map is just a general plotting of all the occurances.

```{python, eval =F}
from pylab import rcParams

%matplotlib inline
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8,6)

# Make the plot larger.
plt.figure(figsize=(16,12))

    
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

eq_map = Basemap(projection='robin', resolution = 'l', area_thresh = 1000.0,
                  lat_0=0, lon_0=-130)  #parameters for map
eq_map.drawcoastlines()
eq_map.drawcountries()
eq_map.fillcontinents(color = 'gray')
eq_map.drawmapboundary()
eq_map.drawmeridians(np.arange(0, 360, 30))
eq_map.drawparallels(np.arange(-90, 90, 30))

x,y = eq_map(longitude, latitude)
eq_map.plot(x, y, 'ro', markersize=6)


plt.figtext(.5,.9,'Stratigraphic Location: Pilosa', fontsize=40, ha='center')

```

Finally, I combined all the parameters to create a final map. Using the information I was able to extract from the age data, I divided the occurences into three categories: beginning of cenozoic to oligocene, miocene, and pliocene to the present. I assigned each of these ranges to a different marker color and plotted the data.

```{python, eval =F}

def get_marker_color(mean_age_list):
    if mean_age_list < 5.33:  #pliocene to present
        return ('go')
    elif mean_age_list < 23.03:  #miocene
        return ('yo')
    else:
        return ('ro')  #oligocene to the beginning of Cenozoic (all of this is in Cenozoic)


eq_map = Basemap(projection='robin', resolution = 'l', area_thresh = 1000.0,
                  lat_0=0, lon_0=-130)
eq_map.drawcoastlines()
eq_map.drawcountries()
eq_map.fillcontinents(color = 'gray')
eq_map.drawmapboundary()
eq_map.drawmeridians(np.arange(0, 360, 30))
eq_map.drawparallels(np.arange(-90, 90, 30))

for lon, lat, age in zip(longitude, latitude, mean_age_list):
    
    x,y = eq_map(lon, lat)
    marker_string = get_marker_color(age)
    eq_map.plot(x, y, marker_string, markersize=8)

plt.figtext(.5,.9,'Stratigraphic Location: Pilosa 2', fontsize=30, ha='center')

plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

As mentioned earlier, sloths are poor regulators of body temperature because they have little ability to increase their metabolism due to their small muscle masses. After plotting my data, I looked for any trends that would indicate this shift from cooler temperatures to more tropic temperatures. To help do so, I compared it to a world map that depicts the tropics around the equator(see figure 3 below). In general, there seems to be a trend of occurances moving north. The red and yellow markers remain primarily in the south while the green markers are spread in both regions, but heavily in North America. I was hoping to see a more obvious movement towards the equator in the Basemap, for I do not think it can lead to any conclusive data. Rather it could lead to further inevestigation with different maps, perhaps differentiating every individual age rather than a range of ages.
