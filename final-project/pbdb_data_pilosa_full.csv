MacFadden et al., indicate that the locality is constrained by 40K/40Ar ages of 12.83 ± 0.11 Ma and 11.96 ± 0.11 Ma, and that the local magnetostratigraphy is correlated to chrons C5AA through C5A on the MPTS. The extrapolated age for the fossil mammals (based on paleomag) is 13.0 to 12.7 Ma = Laventan SALMA. Although specific statigraphic data were taken for the specimens collected by MacFadden and Wolff, these data were not provided in the publication. MacFadden et al. (1990) indicate that most of the fossil mammals come from a zone ""between about 25 to 82 m within our composite measured section."" ","(From MacFadden and Wolff, 1981) ""The section at Quebrada Honda is divisible into three major parts which appear to represent different environments of deposition. The first, or basal portion (lower quarter of section), consists primarily of extremely fossiliferous reddish-brown silty clays, silts, and sands. The majority of the fossils collected during 1978 cane from this part of the stratigraphic section. Near the edges of the Tertiary valley the silts and clays rest upon a basal breccia conglomerate formed by slope wash from the surrounding hills. This breccia conglomerate does not extend far toward the center of the basin;, where the silts and clays rest on the Paleozoic basement. The middle half of the section consists of slightly fossiliferous silty clays and numerous well-indurated calcareous zones that form prominent ledges and cliffs. The third portion (upper quarter) of the section consists of reddish-brown and yellowish-green clays and clay silts, zones of channel sands, gravels, and conglomerates. Quaternary deposits rest unconformably upon the Tertiary sediments at the top of the section. The uppermost Tertiary sediments yielded only rare bone fragments, and exposures are uncommon and difficult to work. Sixty-two paleomagnetic sites, each consisting of at least 3 separately-oriented hand samples, were collected from the finer-grained sediments in Sections 1 and 2 at Quebrada Honda (Fig. 2; stratigraphic separation between superposed sites averages 4-5 m. These samples are presently being analysed at the University of Florida Paleomagnetic Laboratory. The relatively thick stratigraphic section and closely spaced paleomagnetic sampling provides an excellent potential for establishing the age of the Quebrada Honda sequence by calibration to the Magnetic Polarity Time Scale. At least 8 ashes crop out in the Quebrada Honda sequence. Most of these appear to be sub-aerial deposits. Bulk ash samples (about 50 kg) were collected from Section 1, Unit 9 and Section 2, Unit 17. Preliminary laboratory examination of these samples demonstrates that (particularly Section 2, Unit 17), they have significant quantities of glass and zircons that would be datable by the fission-track method. In addition, hand samples of the other 6 ashes were collected in order to determine which of these are also potentially datable.""\r\n\r\nFrom MacFadden et al., (1990): ""These sections consist of about 300 m of principally fine-grained fluviatile sediments with predominant lithologies reddish brown and yellowish-green silty clays, silts, and fine sands. There are also coarser, lenticular challen sands and gravels, but these are localized.""","claystone","","","silty,calcareous","Y","""siliciclastic""","red or brown","","silty,sandy","Y","fluvial indet.","intermontane basin","","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","permineralized","","parautochthonous","time-averaged","","","","","","","","","MacFadden and Wolff (1981): ""The fossil material is generally very well preserved.

MacFadden et al., indicate that the locality is constrained by 40K/40Ar ages of 12.83 ± 0.11 Ma and 11.96 ± 0.11 Ma, and that the local magnetostratigraphy is correlated to chrons C5AA through C5A on the MPTS. The extrapolated age for the fossil mammals (based on paleomag) is 13.0 to 12.7 Ma = Laventan SALMA. Although specific statigraphic data were taken for the specimens collected by MacFadden and Wolff, these data were not provided in the publication. MacFadden et al. (1990) indicate that most of the fossil mammals come from a zone ""between about 25 to 82 m within our composite measured section."" ","(From MacFadden and Wolff, 1981) ""The section at Quebrada Honda is divisible into three major parts which appear to represent different environments of deposition. The first, or basal portion (lower quarter of section), consists primarily of extremely fossiliferous reddish-brown silty clays, silts, and sands. The majority of the fossils collected during 1978 cane from this part of the stratigraphic section. Near the edges of the Tertiary valley the silts and clays rest upon a basal breccia conglomerate formed by slope wash from the surrounding hills. This breccia conglomerate does not extend far toward the center of the basin;, where the silts and clays rest on the Paleozoic basement. The middle half of the section consists of slightly fossiliferous silty clays and numerous well-indurated calcareous zones that form prominent ledges and cliffs. The third portion (upper quarter) of the section consists of reddish-brown and yellowish-green clays and clay silts, zones of channel sands, gravels, and conglomerates. Quaternary deposits rest unconformably upon the Tertiary sediments at the top of the section. The uppermost Tertiary sediments yielded only rare bone fragments, and exposures are uncommon and difficult to work. Sixty-two paleomagnetic sites, each consisting of at least 3 separately-oriented hand samples, were collected from the finer-grained sediments in Sections 1 and 2 at Quebrada Honda (Fig. 2; stratigraphic separation between superposed sites averages 4-5 m. These samples are presently being analysed at the University of Florida Paleomagnetic Laboratory. The relatively thick stratigraphic section and closely spaced paleomagnetic sampling provides an excellent potential for establishing the age of the Quebrada Honda sequence by calibration to the Magnetic Polarity Time Scale. At least 8 ashes crop out in the Quebrada Honda sequence. Most of these appear to be sub-aerial deposits. Bulk ash samples (about 50 kg) were collected from Section 1, Unit 9 and Section 2, Unit 17. Preliminary laboratory examination of these samples demonstrates that (particularly Section 2, Unit 17), they have significant quantities of glass and zircons that would be datable by the fission-track method. In addition, hand samples of the other 6 ashes were collected in order to determine which of these are also potentially datable.""\r\n\r\nFrom MacFadden et al., (1990): ""These sections consist of about 300 m of principally fine-grained fluviatile sediments with predominant lithologies reddish brown and yellowish-green silty clays, silts, and fine sands. There are also coarser, lenticular challen sands and gravels, but these are localized.""","claystone","","","silty,calcareous","Y","""siliciclastic""","red or brown","","silty,sandy","Y","fluvial indet.","intermontane basin","","macrofossils,mesofossils","","","","","","","","permineralized","","parautochthonous","time-averaged","","","","","","","","","MacFadden and Wolff (1981): ""The fossil material is generally very well preserved.

The latter is comparatively rare, but seems to resemble Dusicyon (Lycalopex) in its cranial characteristics.\r\nThe conclusion resulting from this first investigation is that a large wolf-like creature existed in the Pleistocene of Peru and that this creature belongs within the genus Canis and is closely related to C. dirus of the Californian Pleistocene tar pits. Until further material has been developed from the matrix it is too early to state definitely whether it is identical with C. dirus or not, and it is proposed for the present to refrain from giving the Peruvian wolf a separate name, since its synonymity with C. dirus is a distinct possibility.","terrestrial","","actively mobile","ground dwelling","","herbivore","viviparous","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

It is a continental, nearly flat-lying unit composed of massive, pale red to pinkish siltstones and fine-grained sandstones with interbedded, poorly developed palaeosols (e.g., Linares et al., 1980; Goin et al., 2000). This lithostratigraphic unit is considered the distal portion of a clastic wedge related to the late Cenozoic Andean fold and thrust belt that is well developed in the neighbouring Mendoza Province. The maximum outcropping thickness is about 40 m, although the exposures are generally less than 5 m thick. The Cerro Azul Formation has yielded numerous vertebrate remains, specially mammals, which are referred to the Huayquerian land mammal age, which is of late Miocene age (Pascual and Bondesio, 1982; Montalvo and Casadio, 1988; Goin et al., 2000; Verzi et al., 1991, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2004; Montalvo et al., 1995, 1996, 1998; Esteban et al., 2001; Cerdeno and Montalvo, 2001, 2002). The base of the Cerro Azul Formation is covered and its top is overlain by Pliocene and younger (mostly aeolian) sediments or is composed of a discontinuous calcrete crust that forms a resistant layer responsible for the preservation from erosion of the unit. In the subsurface, the unit reaches ~370 m thick overlying older Cenozoic sediments or basement rocks (De Elorriaga and Tullio, 1998).","The lithology of the section is monotonous, and mostly composed of carbonate-cemented greyish orange pink (5 YR 7/2) siltstones and fine-grained sandstones. The distinction of horizons in the soil profiles is poor and the stacked palaeosols are 1.7 m (lower) and 1.9 m (upper) thick. Both palaeosols are separated by a 2 to 7 cm thick, discontinuous bed of laminated, greyish-pink mudstone with mudcracks. Beneath the lower palaeosol lies a 0.5 m thick interval with poor pedogenic modification, which is a siltstone with abundant glass shards and no carbonate cementation. Each palaeosol exhibits a 1.2 to 1.4 m thick interval with greater carbonate cementation that is considered as a calcic horizon. The upper soil profile shows a second uppermost horizon, 0.30 m thick, more clayey than the rest of de soil, with fine prismatic peds and Celliforma isp. (fossil bee cell). Most conspicuous features of both palaeosols include pervasive (although not uniform) carbonate (micritic calcite) cementation, pedogenic slickensides and clastic dykes. Carbonate cementation is not homogeneous in the section. Calcium carbonate content is minimum (~1%) in the lower part of each palaeosol, increasing upward (~10%). At the field, carbonate cement appears as calcareous concretions with dominantly sub-vertical arrangement (up to 15 cm long and 5 cm diameter) and scarce nodules (1 to 2 cm in diameter). Pedogenic slickensides constitute curved, striated, clayey surfaces with a circular roughly concentric arrangement in plan view and a conical 3D pattern. These structures are 0.2 to 0.7 m in diameter and 1 m deep. Clastic dykes are 1 to 7 cm thick, sub-vertical, and filled by two to four pairs of symmetrical muddy laminae showing subtle lithology and colour contrasts. The classic dykes show no preferred orientation.","siltstone","paleosol/pedogenic,gray","lithified","calcareous","Y","sandstone","fine","lithified","","","""floodplain""","","The recovered fauna, notoungulates and rodents specially, is indicative of steppes or herbaceous plains.

After a short period of exposure before burial, they were probably dispersed and sorted by action of wind from the original depositional area. Macromammals would have suffered a natural and gradual death, followed by a long period of exposure to weathering and physical agents. Both groups of remains, once buried, suffered pedogenic and diagenetic processes.","taphonomic","bulk,sieve,field collection","","","11647 specimens","","","","The collection includes all materials from surface prospecting. The low gradient of the modern margin of the depression favoured the erosive action by physical processes that loosened the fossils from the host material. For this reason, bone remains are frequently found in small concentrations produced by running water during rains. During a single visit to the site, 1955 specimens were recovered, 94.53% of them loose, and just 5.47% within the host material. Both the loose and in situ remains appeared throughout the exposed surface of the two palaeosol levels, randomly distributed, disarticulated and dispersed. The in situ material was found scattered in the host siltstone as well as in calcite concretions.","No complete skulls or skeletons were found in the studied assemblage. The whole recovered sample comprises 11,647 pieces, including 5598 anatomically and taxonomically iden- tified remains, and 6049 undetermined fragments, mostly splinters. Taxonomically determined remains include 1277 isolated postcranial elements attributed to undeterminable Mammalia, 23 to undeterminable Aves, 2894 scutes of xenarthran carapaces, and five tortoise scutes. Besides, there are 1396 cranial elements (including isolated teeth) assigned to different mammal taxa and three to Teiidae reptiles.","terrestrial","","actively mobile","ground dwelling","","herbivore","viviparous","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

After a short period of exposure before burial, they were probably dispersed and sorted by action of wind from the original depositional area.

Both groups of remains, once buried, suffered pedogenic and diagenetic processes.","taphonomic","bulk,sieve,field collection","","","11647 specimens","","","","The collection includes all materials from surface prospecting. The low gradient of the modern margin of the depression favoured the erosive action by physical processes that loosened the fossils from the host material. For this reason, bone remains are frequently found in small concentrations produced by running water during rains. During a single visit to the site, 1955 specimens were recovered, 94.53% of them loose, and just 5.47% within the host material. Both the loose and in situ remains appeared throughout the exposed surface of the two palaeosol levels, randomly distributed, disarticulated and dispersed. The in situ material was found scattered in the host siltstone as well as in calcite concretions.","No complete skulls or skeletons were found in the studied assemblage. The whole recovered sample comprises 11,647 pieces, including 5598 anatomically and taxonomically iden- tified remains, and 6049 undetermined fragments, mostly splinters. Taxonomically determined remains include 1277 isolated postcranial elements attributed to undeterminable Mammalia, 23 to undeterminable Aves, 2894 scutes of xenarthran carapaces, and five tortoise scutes. Besides, there are 1396 cranial elements (including isolated teeth) assigned to different mammal taxa and three to Teiidae reptiles.","terrestrial","","actively mobile","ground dwelling","","herbivore","viviparous","","hydroxyapatite","","",""

Resting atop this shallow lacustrine succes- sion is a thin bed of unconsolidated white ash-fall material composed of felsic glass shards and small, rounded grains of black obsidian. In this part of the succession, camelid and proboscidean footprints were found. Moving up the section, the green tuffaceous claystone beds alternate with pale red, sometimes with irregular green spots, tuffaceous mudstone, and rare layers of epiclastic-volcanic, fine- to medium-grained, distinctly laminated sandstone that in places displays convoluted and/or graded bedding. The clastic succession above the first sandstone layer in the section lacks beds with ostracods and gastropods, and the proportion of reddish claystone and mudstone steadily increases upward. Higher up in the section exists an approximately 12-m-thick succession composed of several ero- sion-resistant beds of medium- to coarse-grained, slightly con- glomeratic (clasts up to 1 cm) epiclastic-volcanic sandstone that in places displays structures such as convoluted bedding, bioturba- tion, normal graded bedding, cross bedding, and shallow channels (several meters wide and tens of centimeters deep). Associated with these sandstone beds are thin, clay-rich, unconsolidated horizons that are interpreted as paleosols. Both the cemented conglomeratic sandstone beds and loose paleosols contain mammal fossils. Without any apparent break, this coarse-grained interval is followed by ,10 m of finer sediments (mudstones and sandy clays) in thick, massive beds with alternating green and red colors. Near the top of the exposed section, the proportion of conglomeratic sandstone and fine-grained conglomerate notably increases, as does the maximum clast size (up to 5 cm), while the finer-grained, reddish mudstone layers decrease.
