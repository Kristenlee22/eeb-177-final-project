Pectinids such as Amusium mortoni (early Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene), Euvola codercola (latest Miocene to Pliocene), and Nodipecten arnoldi (late Pliocene to early Pleistocene) suggest an age close to the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. A number of internal molds of a shell similar to Acrosterigma dalli (Heilprin, 1887) were also collected. Acrosterigma dalli is known only from the earliest Pleistocene of Florida, and is not easily confused with other cardiid bivalves. A mean age of 3.2 Ma (range of 3.40 Ma to 2.78 Ma) is calculated for the shell bed at the top of the formation from\r\n87 86 Sr/ Sr ratios. A late Pliocene (Piacenzian) age is assigned to the Ware Formation on the basis of macroinvertebrate biostratigraphy and 87Sr/86Sr isotope chronostratigraphy.","The formation is composed of greyish yellow fine lithic to quartz sandstone and muddy lithic to quartz sandstone, light grey mudstone, reddish grey pebbly conglomerate with sedimentary and metamorphic rock fragments, yellowish grey fossiliferous packstone, and sandy to conglomeratic beds with high fossil content.

Thick levels of fine lithic to quartz sandstone and sandy mudstone with cross- and planar bedding, and metric clinoforms compose the middle part of the sequence (~15 m).

They did not name the site. Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) named the new genus and species _Antarctodolops dailyi_ on the basis of the same specimens and called the site RV-8200. Both abbreviations refer to the University of California at Riverside. According to Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984), the collection was made in the summer of 1982.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Marenssi et al. (1994), scientists of the Departamento Científico de Paleontología de Vertebrados of the Museo de La Plata (DPV-MLP) and of the Instituto Antártico Argentino (IAA) collected fossils on Seymour Island starting in the 1980s. In addition to several new sites, they collected additional specimens at the UCR site, now called DPV 6/84. They mention (p. 5) that American authors also call this site ""IPS locality 445"", the ""Rocket Site"", or the ""Mammal Site"".\r\n\r\nDPV 6/84 is located on the southern side of a canyon unofficially named ""Breakwind Canyon"". Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984) give the coordinates as 64°13'S, 56°40'W, but these coordinates appear to be in the sea northwest of the island. Maps showing the location of DPV 6/84 were published by several authors, including Woodburne and Zinsmeister (1984, fig. 1), Cione and Reguero (1994: fig. 2), Marenssi et al.

The finer-grained beds between the shell banks are finely laminated, and exhibit ripple marks and flaser bedding. Vertical and oblique burrows are common throughout the finer-grained units. Small to large cut-and-fill channel features occur within the sandy silt-stone facies. Prominent slump structures and lenses of gravel are associated with these channels. The shell banks consist of individual beds that range in thickness from .5 to 2m, and extend laterally as much as 1km. The banks are characterized by coarse- to fine-grained, well-sorted arkosic sandstone beds that contain pebble- to cobble-sized clasts. Most of the shell banks are extremely fossiliferous.
